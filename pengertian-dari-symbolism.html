They love coming here simply because of the distinctive Dutch symbolism and the immensely long corridors leading to the offices on the other side.
Lawang Sewu is famous for the Thousand Doors and windows and the fascinating long winding windows representing the Dutch Symbolism of the places.
The building has numerous long winding corridors which open out to the offices on one side of the office and the other end of the building on the other hand. It is a famous landmark on the region of Semarang.
The place was actually built as the main colonial office for the Dutch and was then taken over by Japanese government. This place was important because it was used for giving shelter to the soldiers here.

                                            Text 1 One of the seven wonders of the ancient world, the Great Pyramid of Giza was a monument of wisdom and prophecy built as a tomb for Pharaoh Cheops in 2720 B.C. Despite its antiquity, certain aspects of its construction make it one of the truly great wonders of the world. The thirteen-acre structure near the Nile River is a solid mass of stone blocks covered with limestone. Inside are a number of hidden passageways and the burial chamber for the pharaoh. It is the largest single structure in the world. The four sides of the pyramid are aligned almost exactly on the true north, south, east, and west—an incredible engineering feat. So amazing was the structure of the Great Pyramid despite its antiquity that it caused many experts to scratch their heads as to ask about who might have been this superstructure’s builders. Explorations and detailed examinations of the base of the structure reveal many intersecting lines. Further scientific study indicates that these represent a type of timeline of events—past, present, and future. Many of the events have been interpreted and found to coincide with known facts of the past. Others are prophesied for future generations and are currently under investigation. Many believe that pyramids have supernatural powers, and this one is no exception. Some researchers even associate it with extra-terrestrial beings of the ancient past.23.

                                            Lawang Sewu is an important place in Semarang and for many years tourists have been returning to Semarang only to have a glimpse of this amazing place here. They love coming here simply because of the distinctive Dutch symbolism and the immensely long corridors leading to the offices on the other side.
Lawang Sewu is famous for the Thousand Doors and windows and the fascinating long winding windows representing the Dutch Symbolism of the places.
The building has numerous long winding corridors which open out to the offices on one side of the office and the other end of the building on the other hand. It is a famous landmark on the region of Semarang.
The place was actually built as the main colonial office for the Dutch and was then taken over by Japanese government. This place was important because it was used for giving shelter to the soldiers here. The place was often considered to be haunted place as many people believed that the place was inhabited by spirits and ghosts.
However, later the place was converted into a heritage site and many come to visit the place during their holidays or vacation while coming to visit Semarang.

                                            Talaga warna Long time ago, there was a kingdom in West Java. The kingdom was ruled by a king named His Majesty Prabu.Prabu was a kind and wise king. But it was a pity that Prabu and his queen hadn’t got any children. The queen often cried. That was why Prabu went to the jungle. There he prayed to God every day, begging for a child.A few months later, the queen got pregnant. Nine months later, a princess was born. Prabu and Queen loved their beautiful daughter so much. They gave whatever she wanted. It made Princess turn into a very spoiled girl.One day, the princess celebrated her 17th birthday party. Many people gathered in the palace. Then, Prabu took out a necklace which was made from gold and jewel.“My beloved daughter, today I give you this necklace. Please, wear this necklace,” said Prabu.“I don’t want to wear it! It’s ugly!” shouted the princess. Then she threw the necklace. The beautiful necklace was broken. The gold and jewels were spread out on the floor. Everybody couldn’t say anything. They never thought that their beloved princess would do that cruel thing. In their silence, people heard the queen crying. Every woman felt sad and began crying, too. Then, everybody was crying. Then, there was a miracle. Earth was crying.Nowadays, people called the lake “Telaga Warna”. It means “Lake of Color”. On a bright day, the lake is full of color. These colors come from shadows of forest, plants, flowers, and sky around the lake. But some people said that the colors are from the princess’s necklace, which spreads at the bottom of the lake.1.

                                            Our Legacy
Batik is Indonesian national heritage. Other nations have cloths that look like Batik. However, on October 2, 2009, 
UNESCO declared that batik originates in Indonesia. UNESCO also proclaimed Indonesian batik a Masterpiece Heritage of 
Humanity. In brief, batik serves as our national identity, and it is, indeed, our legacy.
Batik, our beautiful Indonesian traditional cloth, has been part of Indonesian life. Mothers use a batik sling when they 
carry their infant. Men and women wear batik clothes at receptions, ceremonies, and other formal and social events. They 
also use batik as casual wear at home and at places for recreation. When a person dies, people cover him or her with batik 
with funerary motifs. In addition, people use batik for home furniture such as bed sheets and covers, and tablecloths. Bags, 
shoes, hats, and other accessories also often use batik patterns. All in all, batik has a rich symbolism related ti Indonesian 
society, nature, history, and culture.

The Tide Rises, The Tide Falls
   H. W. Longfellow
The tide rises, the tide falls
The twilight darkens, the curlew calls;
Along the sea-sands damp and brown
The traveler hastens toward the town,
    And the tide rises, the tide falls.
Darkness settles on roofs and walls,
But the sea, the sea in the darkness calls;
The little waves, with their soft, white hands,
Efface the footprints in the sands,
     And the tide rises, the tide falls.
The morning breaks; the steeds in their stalls 
Stamp and neigh, as the hostler calls;
The day returns, but nevermore
Returns the traveler to the shore,
     And the tide rises, the tide falls.

                        <p>1. The Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes how the wavefunction of a quantum system evolves over time. It's significant because it provides a framework to understand the behavior of particles on a quantum level, allowing us to predict their probabilities and states.</p><p></p><p>2. "The book, which I'm reading, is really interesting."</p><p></p><p>3. The Latin phrase "Cogito, ergo sum" translates to "I think, therefore I am" in English. It has significant philosophical implications, as it represents the foundation of René Descartes' philosophy. It signifies that one's existence is certain because the act of doubting or thinking itself proves that one exists as a thinking being.</p><p></p><p>4. Differences between British English and American English include variations in spelling (e.g., "colour" in British English, "color" in American English) and pronunciation (e.g., "schedule" pronounced differently). These differences have evolved over time and are influenced by historical and regional factors.</p><p></p><p>5. Symbolism and foreshadowing play essential roles in William Faulkner's "The Sound and the Fury." Symbolism is evident in the Compson family's decline, while foreshadowing hints at tragic events in the narrative, building tension and creating a deeper layer of meaning.</p><p></p><p>6. Artificial intelligence has a significant impact on the job market, automating tasks and changing the nature of work. Ethical considerations involve issues like bias in algorithms, privacy, and the potential for job displacement, highlighting the need for responsible AI development.</p><p></p><p>7. Climate change is an urgent issue threatening our planet. We must take immediate action to reduce carbon emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and adopt sustainable practices. Failing to act now will have dire consequences for future generations.</p><p></p><p>8. I'd need a specific passage from a classic work of literature to translate into modern English while preserving its original meaning and style.</p><p></p><p>9. Shakespeare's Sonnet 18, "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" is written in a historical context when sonnets were a popular form of poetry. It employs techniques like metaphor and personification to praise the eternal beauty of the subject, contrasting it with the fleeting nature of summer.</p><p></p><p>10. I'm sorry, but I can't solve crossword puzzles as they require interactive visual and spatial elements. However, I can provide explanations and hints for individual clues if needed.</p><p></p><p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Here are brief responses for each of the questions:</p><p></p><p>1. The Schrödinger equation describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. It plays a central role in quantum mechanics and predicts probabilistic outcomes rather than definite ones. </p><p></p><p>2. The book, which I'm reading, is really interesting.</p><p></p><p>3. "I think, therefore I am" implies that the very act of thinking proves one's existence.  </p><p></p><p>4. British English has extra vowels and typically pronounces "r" sounds, while American English has rhotic accents and spelling variations like "color" vs "colour".</p><p></p><p>5. Faulkner uses symbolic characters and foreshadowing of impending family tragedy in The Sound and the Fury to explore themes of moral decline in the American South.</p><p></p><p>6. AI may automate certain jobs but also create new ones; ethical risks involve bias, accountability, and invasions of privacy. </p><p></p><p>7. [Persuasive essay on climate change]</p><p></p><p>8.

                            14. Text 1 One of the seven wonders of the ancient world, the Great Pyramid of Giza was a monument of wisdom and prophecy built as a tomb for Pharaoh Cheops in 2720 B.C. Despite its antiquity, certain aspects of its construction make it one of the truly great wonders of the world. The thirteen-acre structure near the Nile River is a solid mass of stone blocks covered with limestone. Inside are a number of hidden passageways and the burial chamber for the pharaoh. It is the largest single structure in the world. The four sides of the pyramid are aligned almost exactly on the true north, south, east, and west—an incredible engineering feat. So amazing was the structure of the Great Pyramid despite its antiquity that it caused many experts to scratch their heads as to ask about who might have been this superstructure’s builders. Explorations and detailed examinations of the base of the structure reveal many intersecting lines. Further scientific study indicates that these represent a type of timeline of events—past, present, and future. Many of the events have been interpreted and found to coincide with known facts of the past. Others are prophesied for future generations and are currently under investigation. Many believe that pyramids have supernatural powers, and this one is no exception. Some researchers even associate it with extra-terrestrial beings of the ancient past.23.

                            15. Lawang Sewu is an important place in Semarang and for many years tourists have been returning to Semarang only to have a glimpse of this amazing place here. They love coming here simply because of the distinctive Dutch symbolism and the immensely long corridors leading to the offices on the other side.
Lawang Sewu is famous for the Thousand Doors and windows and the fascinating long winding windows representing the Dutch Symbolism of the places.
The building has numerous long winding corridors which open out to the offices on one side of the office and the other end of the building on the other hand. It is a famous landmark on the region of Semarang.
The place was actually built as the main colonial office for the Dutch and was then taken over by Japanese government. This place was important because it was used for giving shelter to the soldiers here. The place was often considered to be haunted place as many people believed that the place was inhabited by spirits and ghosts.
However, later the place was converted into a heritage site and many come to visit the place during their holidays or vacation while coming to visit Semarang.

                            17. Talaga warna Long time ago, there was a kingdom in West Java. The kingdom was ruled by a king named His Majesty Prabu.Prabu was a kind and wise king. But it was a pity that Prabu and his queen hadn’t got any children. The queen often cried. That was why Prabu went to the jungle. There he prayed to God every day, begging for a child.A few months later, the queen got pregnant. Nine months later, a princess was born. Prabu and Queen loved their beautiful daughter so much. They gave whatever she wanted. It made Princess turn into a very spoiled girl.One day, the princess celebrated her 17th birthday party. Many people gathered in the palace. Then, Prabu took out a necklace which was made from gold and jewel.“My beloved daughter, today I give you this necklace. Please, wear this necklace,” said Prabu.“I don’t want to wear it! It’s ugly!” shouted the princess. Then she threw the necklace. The beautiful necklace was broken. The gold and jewels were spread out on the floor. Everybody couldn’t say anything. They never thought that their beloved princess would do that cruel thing. In their silence, people heard the queen crying. Every woman felt sad and began crying, too. Then, everybody was crying. Then, there was a miracle. Earth was crying.Nowadays, people called the lake “Telaga Warna”. It means “Lake of Color”. On a bright day, the lake is full of color. These colors come from shadows of forest, plants, flowers, and sky around the lake. But some people said that the colors are from the princess’s necklace, which spreads at the bottom of the lake.1.

Batik is Indonesian national heritage. Other nations have cloths that look like Batik. However, on October 2, 2009, 
UNESCO declared that batik originates in Indonesia. UNESCO also proclaimed Indonesian batik a Masterpiece Heritage of 
Humanity. In brief, batik serves as our national identity, and it is, indeed, our legacy.
Batik, our beautiful Indonesian traditional cloth, has been part of Indonesian life. Mothers use a batik sling when they 
carry their infant. Men and women wear batik clothes at receptions, ceremonies, and other formal and social events. They 
also use batik as casual wear at home and at places for recreation. When a person dies, people cover him or her with batik 
with funerary motifs. In addition, people use batik for home furniture such as bed sheets and covers, and tablecloths. Bags, 
shoes, hats, and other accessories also often use batik patterns. All in all, batik has a rich symbolism related ti Indonesian 
society, nature, history, and culture.

The Tide Rises, The Tide Falls
   H. W. Longfellow
The tide rises, the tide falls
The twilight darkens, the curlew calls;
Along the sea-sands damp and brown
The traveler hastens toward the town,
    And the tide rises, the tide falls.
Darkness settles on roofs and walls,
But the sea, the sea in the darkness calls;
The little waves, with their soft, white hands,
Efface the footprints in the sands,
     And the tide rises, the tide falls.
The morning breaks; the steeds in their stalls 
Stamp and neigh, as the hostler calls;
The day returns, but nevermore
Returns the traveler to the shore,
     And the tide rises, the tide falls.
Questions:
What do these words (curlew, hastens, efface, steeds, hostler) mean?
What images does the poet present?
Discuss the possible symbolism of the third and fourth lines of the second stanza.
What are the other examples of symbolism in the poem?
